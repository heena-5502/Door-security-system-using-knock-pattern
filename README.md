# Door-security-system-using-knock-pattern

Security is a major concern in our day-to-day life, therefore, introduction of digital locks has become an important part in these security systems. 
This project is based on Arduino Uno board and IOT and works based on the knocking pattern.The knocking pattern is detected and passed onto the Arduino Uno consisting of the correct knock pattern . If the knocking pattern matches the correct pattern recorded, the onboard LED is turned ON and the lock is opened.
